# Illusion StudioNodeTweaks
A simple plugin that does a few things with nodes to make it easier to pose in the studio. All options are toggleable in the config.

# Tooltips
When mousing over a node, a tooltip will display a user friendly name that can be easily understood, such as Waist or Hand. Despite this, you may still get a raw bone name, but it's still much better than having no information. When mousing over the root node of characters, you will get their name. And with objects, you'll get their raw name.

# Colorizes IK Nodes
IK nodes can blend into each other when looking at them from certain angles and in certain poses. This applies some carefully selected colors to IK nodes, and only IK nodes, which heavily increase visibility. You can always change the colors or disable colorizing though.

With this feature, you can also set the alpha values of nodes when they're unselected to make them easier to see.

# Nodes Pulse Effect
Nodes will do a small pulsing effect that pauses when you hover over the node so as to prevent the node from escaping your cursor. The idea is just to make them more distinguishable and easier to find with your eyes when looking at a cluttered scene.
